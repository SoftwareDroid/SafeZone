# SafeSearch

SafeSearch is a productivity-boosting application designed to help users manage their time and focus by restricting access to distracting apps and content.
It was created out of the need for a robust solution that can effectively block unwanted applications and screens while ensuring that these restrictions are difficult to bypass once set.

## Features
- **Comprehensive App Blocking**: Search for and block any app or screen on your device.
- **Persistent Locking**: Once locked and installed, the app cannot be easily removed, ensuring that users stay focused.
- **UI Automation**: Utilizes UI Automation to navigate back to previous screens and kill apps, providing a seamless user experience.

Initially developed to block NSFW, e.g. pornographic content, SafeSearch aims to expand its capabilities to include blocking social media, gambling, and other user-defined content in future updates.
Time restrictions rules are available too e.g. block an app after 3min usage for every 2 hours.
